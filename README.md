# avrutils

Avrutils is a library and build framework for 8-bit AVR development.

The library is mostly code published on my blog http://nerdralph.blogspot.ca
together with my fork of Dean's makefile build system.

Download and extract avrutils, or fork and clone it if you want version
control of your software written with avrutils.
